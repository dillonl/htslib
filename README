HTSlib is an implementation of a unified C library for accessing common file
formats, such as SAM, CRAM, VCF, and BCF, used for high-throughput sequencing
data.  It is the core library used by samtools and bcftools.

This is a CMake-ified version of htslib. Installation is very simple:

mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ../
make


DONE!
